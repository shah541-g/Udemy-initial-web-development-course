# Article on HTML Chapter 01: Introduction to HTML - Building Blocks of Web Pages

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. In this guide, we'll cover the basics of HTML, including its structure, attributes, headings, paragraphs, comments, and quotations with examples.

## 1. Chapter 01 Introduction to HTML

HTML serves as the backbone of web development, providing the structure and content of web pages.

## 2. HTML Introduction and Basic Structure

HTML documents are composed of elements that define the structure and content of web pages.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Title of the document</title>
</head>
<body>
 
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
 
</body>
</html>

```
## 3. HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are defined within the opening tag.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
```

## 4. HTML Headings and Paragraphs
### Headings

HTML provides six levels of headings, from <h1> to <h6>.

```html
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
```

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are defined using the <p> tag.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## 5. HTML Comments (Lecture 158)

HTML comments are used to add notes to the code, which are not displayed in the browser.

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

## 6. HTML Quotations

HTML provides two elements to define quotations: <blockquote> for longer quotations and <q> for shorter inline quotations.

```html
<blockquote>This is a longer quotation.</blockquote>
<p>He said <q>This is a short quotation</q>.</p>
```

## Example: HTML Introduction

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Introduction</title>
</head>
<body>
 
<!-- This is a comment -->
 
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
 
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
 
<a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
 
<blockquote>This is a longer quotation.</blockquote>
<p>He said <q>This is a short quotation</q>.</p>
 
</body>
</html>

```
