## Integrating Images and Links in HTML

Images and links are crucial elements of web design, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of web pages. In this guide, we'll explore how to insert images, use them as links, and manage file paths and URLs effectively in HTML.

## HTML Image Insertion (Lecture 169)
Images are inserted in HTML using the <img> tag. You need to specify the src attribute to define the image source and the alt attribute for accessibility.
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

## Image Importance in Website (Lecture 170)
Images play a significant role in website design, enhancing visual appeal and user engagement. They can convey information, evoke emotions, and improve the overall user experience.

## Image as Link in HTML (Lecture 171)
You can use an image as a link by wrapping the <img> tag inside an <a> tag.
```html
<a href="https://example.com">
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
</a>
```
## HTML File Location Path (Lecture 172)
When linking to local files or images, you need to specify the correct file path. There are two types of paths: absolute and relative.

## HTML Links (Lecture 173)
Links in HTML are created using the <a> tag. You need to specify the href attribute to define the destination URL.
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Link Text</a>
```

## HTML Absolute and Relative URLs (Lecture 174)
### Absolute URL: 
Specifies the complete address of the linked page or resource.

Specifies the path to the linked page or resource relative to the current page.
```html
<a href="page.html">Relative URL</a>
```
